## What is CTR?

**CTR** (Click-Through Rate) is a metric that measures the percentage of people who click on your ad after seeing it. It's a key indicator of ad relevance and effectiveness in digital marketing campaigns.

## CTR Formula

The CTR calculation formula is:

```
CTR = (Clicks / Impressions) × 100
```

### Formula Components

- **Clicks**: The number of times users clicked on your ad
- **Impressions**: The number of times your ad was displayed
- **CTR**: The percentage expressed as a decimal (multiply by 100 for percentage)

## How to Use the CTR Calculator

### Step 1: Enter Total Clicks

Input the number of clicks your ad received.

**Example**: 500 clicks

### Step 2: Enter Total Impressions

Input the number of times your ad was displayed to users.

**Example**: 50,000 impressions

### Step 3: Calculate

Click the "Calculate CTR" button to get your result.

**Result**: CTR = (500 / 50,000) × 100 = **1.0%**

This means 1% of people who saw your ad clicked on it.

## CTR Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Google Search Ad

- **Clicks**: 250
- **Impressions**: 10,000
- **CTR**: (250 / 10,000) × 100 = **2.5%**

### Example 2: Facebook Ad Campaign

- **Clicks**: 800
- **Impressions**: 100,000
- **CTR**: (800 / 100,000) × 100 = **0.8%**

### Example 3: Display Banner Ad

- **Clicks**: 50
- **Impressions**: 25,000
- **CTR**: (50 / 25,000) × 100 = **0.2%**

### Example 4: Email Marketing Campaign

- **Clicks**: 1,200
- **Impressions**: 20,000
- **CTR**: (1,200 / 20,000) × 100 = **6.0%**
