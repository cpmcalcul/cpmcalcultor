## Digital Advertising Formulas

This comprehensive reference guide contains all the essential formulas for calculating advertising metrics, performance indicators, and return on investment. Use this as a quick reference for your marketing campaigns.

## Core Advertising Metrics

### CPM (Cost Per Mille)

**Definition**: Cost per thousand impressions

```
CPM = (Total Ad Spend / Total Impressions) × 1,000
```

**Reverse Calculation**:
```
Total Cost = (Impressions / 1,000) × CPM
Impressions = (Total Cost / CPM) × 1,000
```

**Example**:
- Ad Spend: $500
- Impressions: 250,000
- CPM = ($500 / 250,000) × 1,000 = **$2.00**

**Use Case**: Brand awareness campaigns, display advertising, video ads

### CPC (Cost Per Click)

**Definition**: Cost per individual click

```
CPC = Total Ad Spend / Number of Clicks
```

**Reverse Calculation**:
```
Total Cost = Clicks × CPC
Clicks = Total Cost / CPC
```

**Example**:
- Ad Spend: $500
- Clicks: 1,000
- CPC = $500 / 1,000 = **$0.50**

**Use Case**: Search engine marketing, traffic generation, lead generation

### CTR (Click-Through Rate)

**Definition**: Percentage of impressions that result in clicks

```
CTR = (Clicks / Impressions) × 100
```

**Reverse Calculation**:
```
Clicks = (CTR / 100) × Impressions
Impressions = Clicks / (CTR / 100)
```

**Example**:
- Clicks: 500
- Impressions: 50,000
- CTR = (500 / 50,000) × 100 = **1.0%**

**Use Case**: Measuring ad effectiveness, optimization indicator

### CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)

**Definition**: Cost per conversion or customer acquisition

```
CPA = Total Ad Spend / Number of Conversions
```

**Reverse Calculation**:
```
Total Cost = Conversions × CPA
Conversions = Total Cost / CPA
```

**Example**:
- Ad Spend: $1,000
- Conversions: 50
- CPA = $1,000 / 50 = **$20.00**

**Use Case**: Performance marketing, e-commerce, lead generation

### ROI (Return on Investment)

**Definition**: Percentage return on marketing investment

```
ROI = ((Revenue - Cost) / Cost) × 100
```

**Alternative Formula**:
```
ROI = (Net Profit / Cost) × 100
```

**Reverse Calculation**:
```
Required Revenue = Cost × (1 + ROI/100)
Maximum Cost = Revenue / (1 + ROI/100)
```

**Example**:
- Revenue: $10,000
- Cost: $4,000
- ROI = (($10,000 - $4,000) / $4,000) × 100 = **150%**

**Use Case**: Overall campaign profitability, investment decisions

### ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)

**Definition**: Revenue generated per dollar spent on advertising

```
ROAS = Revenue / Ad Spend
```

**Alternative Expression**:
```
ROAS = (Revenue / Ad Spend) × 100 (as percentage)
```

**Reverse Calculation**:
```
Required Revenue = Ad Spend × ROAS
Maximum Ad Spend = Revenue / ROAS
```

**Example**:
- Revenue: $10,000
- Ad Spend: $2,000
- ROAS = $10,000 / $2,000 = **5:1 or 500%**

**Use Case**: Ad campaign efficiency, platform comparison

## Conversion Metrics

### Conversion Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of visitors who complete desired action

```
Conversion Rate = (Conversions / Total Visitors) × 100
```

**Example**:
- Conversions: 100
- Visitors: 5,000
- Conversion Rate = (100 / 5,000) × 100 = **2.0%**

### Cost Per Lead (CPL)

**Definition**: Cost to acquire one lead

```
CPL = Total Ad Spend / Number of Leads
```

**Example**:
- Ad Spend: $1,500
- Leads: 150
- CPL = $1,500 / 150 = **$10.00**

### Lead to Customer Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of leads that become customers

```
Lead to Customer Rate = (Customers / Leads) × 100
```

**Example**:
- Customers: 30
- Leads: 150
- Lead to Customer Rate = (30 / 150) × 100 = **20%**

## Engagement Metrics

### Engagement Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of audience that engages with content

```
Engagement Rate = (Total Engagements / Total Impressions) × 100
```

**Social Media Alternative**:
```
Engagement Rate = (Likes + Comments + Shares) / Followers × 100
```

**Example**:
- Engagements: 1,500
- Impressions: 50,000

- Total Visits: 5,000
- Bounce Rate = (1,500 / 5,000) × 100 = **30%**

### Time on Page

**Definition**: Average duration visitors spend on a page

```
Average Time on Page = Total Time on Page / Number of Page Views
```

## Revenue Metrics

### Average Order Value (AOV)

**Definition**: Average amount spent per order

```
AOV = Total Revenue / Number of Orders
```

**Example**:
- Total Revenue: $50,000
- Orders: 500
- AOV = $50,000 / 500 = **$100.00**

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Definition**: Total revenue expected from a customer over their lifetime

```
LTV = Average Order Value × Purchase Frequency × Customer Lifespan
```

**Simplified Formula**:
```
LTV = (Average Order Value × Number of Purchases) / Churn Rate
```

**Example**:
- AOV: $100
- Purchase Frequency: 4 per year
- Customer Lifespan: 3 years
- LTV = $100 × 4 × 3 = **$1,200**

### LTV to CAC Ratio

**Definition**: Relationship between customer value and acquisition cost

```
LTV:CAC Ratio = Customer Lifetime Value / Customer Acquisition Cost
```

**Benchmark**:
- **Below 1:1**: Losing money on customers
- **1:1 to 2:1**: Marginal profitability
- **3:1**: Healthy ratio (ideal)
- **Above 5:1**: May be under-investing in growth

**Example**:
- LTV: $1,200
- CAC: $400
- Ratio = $1,200 / $400 = **3:1**

## YouTube Metrics

### YouTube Earnings

**Definition**: Estimated YouTube ad revenue

```
Earnings = (Views / 1,000) × CPM
```

**With Creator Share**:
```
Creator Earnings = (Views / 1,000) × CPM × 0.55
```

**Example**:
- Views: 100,000
- CPM: $5.00
- Creator Earnings = (100,000 / 1,000) × $5 × 0.55 = **$275**

### YouTube RPM (Revenue Per Mille)

**Definition**: Creator's actual revenue per thousand views

```

```

**Example**:
- Revenue: $550
- Views: 100,000
- RPM = ($550 / 100,000) × 1,000 = **$5.50**

## Metric Relationships

### CPM ↔ CPC ↔ CTR

**Relationship**:
```
CPC = CPM / (CTR × 10)
```

**Example**:
- CPM: $5.00
- CTR: 2%
- CPC = $5.00 / (0.02 × 10) = **$2.50**

### CPC ↔ CPA ↔ Conversion Rate

**Relationship**:
```
CPA = CPC / Conversion Rate
```

**Example**:
- CPC: $2.00
- Conversion Rate: 5%
- CPA = $2.00 / 0.05 = **$40.00**

### ROI ↔ ROAS ↔ Profit Margin

**Relationship**:
```
ROI = (ROAS - 1) × 100
ROAS = (ROI / 100) + 1
```

**Example**:
- ROAS: 3:1 (or 300%)
- ROI = (3 - 1) × 100 = **200%**

## Advanced Calculations

### Weighted Average CPM

**Definition**: CPM across multiple platforms weighted by volume

```
Weighted CPM = Σ(CPM × Impressions) / Total Impressions
```

**Example**:
- Platform A: $5 CPM, 100,000 impressions
- Platform B: $3 CPM, 50,000 impressions
- Weighted CPM = ($5 × 100,000 + $3 × 50,000) / 150,000 = **$4.33**

### Statistical Significance

**Definition**: Probability that results are not due to chance

```
Z-Score = (Sample Mean - Population Mean) / Standard Error
```

*Note: Use online calculators for complex statistical significance tests*

### Confidence Interval

**Definition**: Range in which true value likely falls

```
CI = Sample Mean ± (Z-Score × Standard Error)
```

**Common Confidence Levels**:
- 90% confidence: Z = 1.645
- 95% confidence: Z = 1.96
- 99% confidence: Z = 2.576
