      {
        "title": "What is CPM in marketing?",
        "description": "CPM (Return on Investment) measures the profitability of your marketing investments by comparing revenue generated to costs incurred. A positive CPM means you're earning more than you're spending."
      },
      {
        "title": "How do you calculate CPM?",
        "description": "CPM is calculated using the formula: CPM = ((Revenue - Cost) / Cost) × 100%. For example, if you spend $5,000 and generate $10,000 in revenue, your CPM is 100%."
      },
      {
        "title": "What's a good CPM for marketing campaigns?",
        "description": "A good CPM varies by industry and campaign type. Generally, a 5:1 ratio (500% CPM) is considered strong, meaning for every $1 spent, you earn $5 back. However, acceptable CPM depends on your business goals and profit margins."
      },
      {
        "title": "Why is CPM important for businesses?",
        "description": "CPM helps businesses evaluate the effectiveness of their marketing investments, compare different campaigns, allocate budgets efficiently, and make data-driven decisions about future marketing strategies."
      },
      {
        "title": "What's the difference between CPM and ROAS?",
        "description": "CPM measures overall profitability by considering all costs and profits, while ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) focuses specifically on revenue generated per dollar spent on advertising. ROAS is a subset of CPM focused on ad spending."
      },
      {
        "title": "How can I improve my marketing CPM?",
