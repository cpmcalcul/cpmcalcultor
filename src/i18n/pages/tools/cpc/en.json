      {
        "title": "What is CPC in marketing?",
        "description": "CPC (Cost Per Click) measures how much you pay for each click on your ads. It's calculated by dividing total ad spend by the number of clicks. Lower CPC means more efficient ad spending."
      },
      {
        "title": "How do you calculate CPC?",
        "description": "CPC is calculated using the formula: CPC = Total Ad Cost / Number of Clicks. For example, if you spend $5,000 on ads and get 2,000 clicks, your CPC is $2.50 per click."
      },
      {
        "title": "What's a good CPC for marketing campaigns?",
        "description": "A good CPC varies by industry, competition, and campaign goals. Generally, CPCs between $0.50-$3.00 are common, but this depends on your target audience, keywords, and campaign objectives."
      },
      {
        "title": "Why is CPC important for businesses?",
        "description": "CPC helps businesses evaluate the efficiency of their ad spending, compare different campaigns and channels, optimize budgets, and make data-driven decisions about where to invest their advertising dollars."
      },
      {
        "title": "What's the difference between CPC and CPM?",
        "description": "CPC (Cost Per Click) measures cost per click, while CPM (Cost Per Mille) measures cost per 1,000 impressions. CPC is better for measuring engagement, while CPM is better for measuring reach and brand awareness."
      },
      {
        "title": "How can I improve my CPC?",
        "description": "Improve CPC by targeting more qualified audiences, improving ad relevance scores, optimizing landing pages, using negative keywords, testing different ad creatives, and continuously analyzing and optimizing your campaigns."
