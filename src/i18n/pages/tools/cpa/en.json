      {
        "title": "What is CPA in marketing?",
        "description": "CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) measures how much you spend to acquire one customer or conversion. It's calculated by dividing total ad spend by the number of conversions. Lower CPA means more efficient customer acquisition."
      },
      {
        "title": "How do you calculate CPA?",
        "description": "CPA is calculated using the formula: CPA = Total Ad Cost / Number of Conversions. For example, if you spend $5,000 on ads and get 100 conversions, your CPA is $50 per conversion."
      },
      {
        "title": "What's a good CPA for marketing campaigns?",
        "description": "A good CPA varies by industry, product value, and profit margins. Generally, your CPA should be lower than your customer lifetime value (CLV). A CPA that's 20-30% of your CLV is often considered healthy."
      },
      {
        "title": "Why is CPA important for businesses?",
        "description": "CPA helps businesses evaluate the efficiency of their customer acquisition, compare different marketing channels, optimize ad spend, and make data-driven decisions about budget allocation and campaign scaling."
      },
      {
        "title": "What's the difference between CPA and CPC?",
        "description": "CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) measures cost per conversion/customer, while CPC (Cost Per Click) measures cost per click on your ads. CPA is more valuable as it directly relates to business outcomes, while CPC is just an intermediate metric."
      },
      {
        "title": "How can I improve my CPA?",
        "description": "Improve CPA by targeting more qualified audiences, optimizing landing pages for conversions, improving ad relevance scores, testing different ad creatives, using retargeting campaigns, and continuously analyzing and optimizing your funnel."
