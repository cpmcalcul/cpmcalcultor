      {
        "title": "What's a good ROI for marketing campaigns?",
        "description": "A good ROI varies by industry and campaign type. Generally, a 5:1 ratio (500% ROI) is considered strong, meaning for every $1 spent, you earn $5 back. However, acceptable ROI depends on your business goals and profit margins."
