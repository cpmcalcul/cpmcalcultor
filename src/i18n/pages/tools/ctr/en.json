        "title": "What is CTR in marketing?",
        "description": "CTR (Click-Through Rate) measures how often people click on your ads after seeing them. It's calculated as (Clicks / Impressions) × 100%. A higher CTR indicates more engaging and relevant ads."
      },
      {
        "title": "How do you calculate CTR?",
        "description": "CTR is calculated using the formula: CTR = (Clicks / Impressions) × 100%. For example, if your ad gets 100 clicks from 10,000 impressions, your CTR is 1%."
      },
      {
        "title": "What's a good CTR for marketing campaigns?",
        "description": "A good CTR varies by industry and platform. Generally, CTRs between 1-3% are considered good for search ads, while display ads typically have lower CTRs (0.5-1%). Mobile ads often have higher CTRs than desktop."
      },
      {
        "title": "What is CVR and why is it important?",
        "description": "CVR (Conversion Rate) measures how many clicks result in desired actions (purchases, sign-ups, etc.). It's calculated as (Conversions / Clicks) × 100%. CVR helps evaluate the quality of traffic and landing page effectiveness."

      {
        "title": "What's the difference between CTR and CVR?",
        "description": "CTR measures ad engagement (clicks per impression), while CVR measures conversion effectiveness (conversions per click). CTR shows how compelling your ads are, while CVR shows how well your landing pages convert visitors."
